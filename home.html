        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Manraj Gian Singh Bhangra and I am currently a student at
          Aston University. You can e-mail at 230098246@aston.ac.uk or find me
          by using the SUN 230098246!

        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <p>
          I have been coding within various languages since 2018. Languages
          which I have previously worked with would include: Python, Java, SQL,
          HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Assembly Language. I am mostly proficient in
          python and java as they are the two which I have written with the
          most.
          <br />If I was to give an experience rating out of 5 for all of
          languages I would give them the following:
        </p>
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Language</th>
            <th>Rating</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Python</td>
            <td>4/5</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Java</td>
            <td>4/5</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>SQL</td>
            <td>4/5</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>HTML</td>
            <td>3/5</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>JavaScript</td>
            <td>2/5</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>CSS</td>
            <td>2/5</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Assembly</td>
            <td>2/5</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <p>
          <br />
          My more general skills would consist of being able to work both
          independently and collaboratively. As well as this i have the
          capability of taking up a leadership role within a team when needed.
          Furthermore, I also have the ability to speak multiple languages,
          being english and punjabi. Whenever I try and complete a task I will
          try my upmost best to complete it to the highest standard. and knowing
          when I need research for help when needed.

        <h2>Work Experience</h2>
        <p>
          Previously I have done work with building and woodwork, building many
          projects. This has helped me learn the values of hard work and much
          improved my work within coding. Furthermore, within College I
          completed a project in which I simulated the lifecycle of the creation
          of a piece of software, completing all the steps by myself to
          understand how all areas of software development are completed. You
          can see the completed project on my portfolio page!

      <section id="interests">
        <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
        <p>
          Many of my interests focus on teamwork within sports and seeing how
          all components of a team must work for everything to go to plan. An
          example of this is within F1 where everyone must work together for a
          successful season. This is very similar when creating software as
          everyone must work together to create something successfully.
          Furthermore, I like to play team sports such as football as they help
          me improve my leadership and communication skills. Finally, I like
          gaming and puzzle solving to give myself inspiration for when I create
          similar projects.
