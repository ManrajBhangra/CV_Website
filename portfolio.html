          <h3>Python Game</h3>
          <p>
            One of my largest and most creative projects was one where I created
            a game within Python with help of the pygame. For the game I used
            OOP to create classes for the player and enemy characters. These
            classes would be used within the main game code to be displayed and
            used. The game could be played in both single and two player. When
            playing in two a client-server model was used and the server was
            made by myself. Below you can small portions of the code and an
            example video of the game playing.

          <p>
            A more basic algorithm I created within python was one to find a
            Harshad numbers, a number divisible by the sum of its digits. The
            function would take a number being x and find the xth Harshad
            number.

          <h3>Car Race</h3>
          <p>
            One project which I created within Java was a car race. I created
            classes for the car and the track and used these to simulate a race
            between 5 cars. You can reset the race using the s key and the
            scores would be saved on top the cars. The colours of the cars would
            be random every time.

          <h3>Foxes vs Rabbits</h3>
          <p>
            This Java project was not entirely done by my but instead I was
            given starting code which I needed to fix and make work.
            Essentially, this code is a simulation of a field containing foxes
            and rabbits where both animals can breed and foxes can hunt the
            rabbits. However, at all times there must be at least two rabbits so
            they do not all die. Below are some screenshots of the code and
            random result.

          Using all three languages of HTML, SCC and JavaScript I created a
          website called 'Aston Fitness'. The website featured two pages, one
          page for the home and one for the signing up. HTML was used to create
          the pages and give them content whilst CSS was used to create a
          stylesheet for the page. JavaScript was used for validation when
          creating a password.
